Emergency Evacuation Procedure
When the alarm sounds:
Remain calm and stop all work immediately. If you discover a fire or emergency, activate the nearest alarm and call emergency services. Do not attempt to fight fires unless they are small and you are trained to do so.
Evacuate the building:
Leave by the nearest safe exit. Do not use elevators under any circumstances. If you encounter smoke, stay low to the ground where air is clearer. If a door feels hot, do not open it and find an alternative route. Close doors behind you as you leave to help contain fire and smoke.
Assist others:
Help anyone who needs assistance, but do not put yourself in danger. If someone cannot evacuate, move them to the nearest safe area and immediately notify emergency responders of their location.
Assembly point:
Proceed directly to the designated assembly point at least 50 feet from the building. Do not stop to collect personal belongings. Once outside, stay outside and do not re-enter the building for any reason until the all-clear is given by emergency services or your safety officer.
Account for everyone:
Department managers or designated personnel should take a headcount and report any missing individuals to emergency responders immediately. If you notice someone is missing, inform emergency personnel but do not re-enter the building to search.
Wait for all-clear:
Only return to the building when officially authorized by fire department personnel or your company's emergency coordinator. Follow any instructions given by emergency services.
You'll want to add your specific assembly point locations, emergency contact numbers, and any unique features of your building or workplace.
